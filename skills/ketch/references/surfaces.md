# Surfaces — flags, params, and per-surface behavior

Verified against ketch v0.18.0 (main). Discipline 6 applies: `--help` and `ketch config` outrank this file.

## CLI ↔ MCP name mapping

The two transports expose the same options under different spellings. Both directions:

| CLI | MCP | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--regex` | `regexp` | code; grepapp/sourcegraph only |
| `--select <css>` | `selector` | scrape; skips content selection; incompatible with `raw` |
| positional URLs / JSON array / file / stdin | `url` (one) or `urls` (array) | CLI auto-detects the input form; MCP is explicit |
| `--searxng-url` | `searxng_url` | search, searxng backend only |
| `--multi[=list]` | `multi` (array; `["all"]` = every usable) | search; federated RRF search, mutually exclusive with `backend`; CLI needs the `=` form for a list |
| `--resolve` | `resolve` | docs |
| `--no-llms-txt` | `no_llms_txt` | scrape |
| `--force-browser` | `force_browser` | scrape |
| `--max-chars` | `max_chars` | scrape / search-with-scrape; crawl has it on MCP only |
| `--no-cache` | `no_cache` | scrape, crawl |
| `--tag <name>` | `tag` | every surface: search, code, docs, scrape, crawl; composes with `--no-cache` |
| `ketch tag add/show/list/remove` | `tag` tool, `operation` enum | the CLI uses verbs, MCP takes `operation: add\|show\|list\|remove` |
| `--concurrency` (scrape, default 5) | `concurrency` (capped at 16) | crawl's `--concurrency` (default 8) is CLI-only |
| — | `max_pages` | crawl, MCP only: default 30, cap 100; CLI crawl bounds with `--depth`/`--allow`/`--deny` |
| `--minimal`, `--json`, `--background` | — | CLI-only; MCP output is already structured |

## search

- Backends: `auto` (**the default**; not a provider but a fallback chain — tries configured instances, then keyed providers, then the keyless ones `parallel` → `exa` → `keenable` → `youcom` → `firecrawl` → `ddg`, returning the first that answers. The reported `backend` names the provider that actually served, and providers that failed on the way appear as `warn:` stderr lines / the MCP `errors` map. Cannot be used inside `--multi`/`--random`), `brave` (free API key), `ddg` (zero setup; rate-limits readily under fan-out), `searxng` (self-hosted; needs a JSON-enabled instance — see the setup verb), `exa` (zero config), `firecrawl` (Firecrawl v2 search API; keyless by default, optional `firecrawl_api_key` lifts the cap; self-hosted via `firecrawl_url`), `keenable` (keyless by default; optional `keenable_api_key` lifts the rate limit), `tavily` (keyed; extracted content in results; `tavily_api_key`), `parallel` (zero config; hosted Search MCP), `serpbase` (keyed Google results; `serpbase_api_key`), `serply` (keyed Google results, ten per page; `serply_api_key`), `youcom` (You.com web search; keyless by default, optional `youcom_api_key` lifts the rate limit).
- The effective default backend is operator-configured: **omit `backend` to use it**; `ketch config` shows which it is.
- Known upstream help drift (v0.18.0): the `ketch search --help` prose claims “(default: the configured backend; brave if unset)” — the flag default, `ketch config`, and `ketch doctor` all report `auto` (confirmed with no config file present at all).
- `--scrape` / `scrape: true` fetches each result's full content — budget it exactly like a scrape (`max_chars`, `trim`).
- `--minimal` (CLI): one result per line, tab-separated url/title/snippet (a 4th backends column is appended under `--multi` for plain search; `--scrape --minimal` keeps 3 columns).
- `--multi` / `multi: [...]`: federated search — query several backends at once and rank-fuse with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60), deduplicating by URL. Bare `--multi` / `["all"]` = every usable backend (key-presence rule); `--multi=brave,exa` / `["brave","exa"]` = a set (use the `=` form on the CLI). Each result gains a `backends` list (the engines that returned it — a consensus signal worth more than any single float). Backends that error or time out (10s each) are dropped: on the CLI they surface as `warn:` stderr lines + a `failed:` frontmatter key; on MCP as an additive `errors` map. The call fails ([upstream]/exit 4) only when every backend fails. Mutually exclusive with `backend`. Keys improve federation reliability (keyless `ddg`/`exa`/`firecrawl`/`keenable`/`parallel` rate-limit faster under fan-out).

## code

- Backends: `grepapp` (default; keyless, public OSS repos via grep.app), `sourcegraph` (keyless), `github` (auth via `gh auth login`, `$GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `ketch config set github_token <tok>`).
- `lang` is appended to the query as a language filter.
- `regexp` / `--regex`: grepapp and sourcegraph only. github rejects it — `[validation]` / exit 2 with a pointer to the backends that support it.
- grepapp intermittently returns 504 (`[upstream]`); an immediate single retry usually succeeds.

## docs

- Backend: `context7` — curated, version-aware snippets; free key via `ketch config set context7_api_key <key>`. A `local` backend is planned but unimplemented; selecting it is `[precondition]` / exit 5.
- Two-step usage: `resolve` → vet → `library`.
  - Resolve row shape: `/org/repo  Name  (snippets: N, trust: X)`.
  - **Resolve never returns empty.** A garbage query returns confident fuzzy matches, some with trust 8–10. Trust scores the source, not the match — vet that the *name* is the library you meant before fetching by ID.
- `tokens` (default 4000) is the docs token budget; the default returns ~3.3 KB.

## scrape

- **llms.txt:** a bare-domain URL is auto-probed for `/llms.txt` first and may silently return that file instead of the homepage. The `title` in the output reveals the swap. `no_llms_txt` / `--no-llms-txt` opts out.
- Input forms (CLI, auto-detected — no batch flag): single URL, multiple positional args, a JSON array string, a file of URLs, a stdin pipe. MCP: exactly one of `url` or `urls`.
- Batch scrapes run concurrently (CLI default 5; MCP `concurrency` capped at 16). Per-URL failures come back as `results[].error` **inside a successful call** (`isError=false`; CLI `--json` returns an array) — check every entry.
- `max_chars` truncates output and appends `[truncated]`. `trim` strips markdown syntax, keeps text (incompatible with `raw`). `--select`/`selector` extracts by CSS selector, skipping content selection — no match is `[not_found]` / exit 3. `raw` returns HTML instead of markdown.
- **Markdown extraction is lossy; `raw` preserves bytes** (JSON carries them as `raw_html`). Verified on v0.18.0: angle-bracket placeholders are silently dropped — the manual's `ketch config set <provider>_api_key <key>` extracts as `ketch config set \_api\_key` (the source bytes are fine: HTML escapes them as `&lt;provider&gt;`, and llms-full.txt / manifest.json contain them literally) — every `_` comes back backslash-escaped, `text/plain` bodies collapse to a single line, and an XML sitemap glues `<loc>`+`<lastmod>` into a phantom URL that then 404s. Consequence: never copy commands out of scraped output without checking them against `--help`; fetch XML, plain text, or anything you will diff with `raw`.
- JS-rendered pages: JS-shell detection falls back to the configured headless browser automatically, same output shape. `force_browser` skips detection and errors without a configured browser (`[precondition]`).
- Fetches are cached (see Cache below); `no_cache` bypasses.
- Already hold the HTML? `curl -L <url> | ketch extract` runs the same structural extraction + markdown pipeline with no fetch, cache, or browser (CLI-only; supports `--url`, `--select`, `--trim`, `--max-chars`).

## crawl

- Same-host BFS from a seed URL (`--sitemap` treats the seed as a sitemap). Streams pages as found.
- BFS discovers pages from links in **extracted** markdown, and extraction strips site chrome — a page linked only from nav/footer is invisible at any depth (observed: a crawl of a generated single-page site returned the seed and `new: 0`). On such sites seed with `--sitemap`, or read the sitemap with `raw` first.
- **MCP:** synchronous and bounded — `max_pages` default 30, hard cap 100, 3-minute wall clock. Partial results return with `stopped: "max_pages" | "timeout"`. Per-page `max_chars` available.
- **CLI:** `--depth` (default 3), `--allow` path substrings, `--deny` regexes, `--concurrency` (default 8). No page-cap flag — bound with depth and filters.
- **Background mode is CLI-only:** `ketch crawl <url> --background` returns a crawl ID; `ketch crawl status [id]` and `ketch crawl stop <id>` manage it.
- A CLI crawl interrupted by SIGINT exits **0** with the partial results already streamed — by design, not an error.

## tag

Not a research surface: it answers "what did I already find?", not "what is out
there?". No network on any `tag` operation.

`--tag` / the `tag` option works on **every** surface, and one tag holds them
all. Each entry keeps a source URL, bounded title and description, and tagging
time. Descriptions derive from fetched content, code/docs snippets or search
results; full bodies stay in the separate page cache.

| Operation | CLI | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tag what a call returned | `--tag <name>` on `search` / `code` / `docs` / `scrape` / `crawl` | `tag` option on those tools |
| Tag URLs directly (cached or not) | `ketch tag add <name> <url>...` | `operation: add`, `urls` |
| Read the index | `ketch tag show <name> --limit N` (`--minimal` for tab-separated) | `operation: show`, `limit` |
| List tags | `ketch tag list` | `operation: list` |
| Drop a tag, or pages from it | `ketch tag remove <name> [url...]` | `operation: remove`, optional `urls` |

`show` returns titles, URLs, one-line descriptions and a `cached` flag per page,
newest first. Both surfaces default to 50 entries; 0 selects all and negatives
are validation errors. `entries`/`cached` count the whole tag, `shown` counts
returned pages. A source can carry several tags. Membership uses the displayed
URL regardless of cookie, User-Agent or rewrite settings.

**The index outlives the cached bodies.** `cache_ttl` defaults to 72h; index
entries have no TTL. An entry with `cached: false` has no confirmed fresh body;
it does not imply a dead link. If `cache_status: unavailable`, warmth could not
be checked because the page cache was locked or unreadable. `scrape` the URL
when you need its content. `ketch cache clear`
drops bodies and keeps the index. Nothing expires the index, so `remove` is the
only way a tag ends.

`add` accepts a URL whose page was never fetched: it is indexed with no title
or description, listed as uncached, and both fill in the first time the page is
seen by any route. The returned `not_cached` array names those — scrape them if
you want the index to describe them now. `add` requires absolute `http(s)` URLs
with a host — anything else is `[validation]` / exit 2, and a batch with one bad
URL tags nothing. `remove` with URLs returns `missing` for the ones that were not
under the tag; a batch that removes nothing is `[not_found]` / exit 3.

`cached: false` is the normal state for entries from `code`, `docs` and
unscraped `search`: those surfaces return snippets, not fetched pages. The
snippet is kept as the entry's description, so the index is still useful
without a round trip.

Errors: `remove` that matches nothing is `[not_found]` / exit 3, including JSON
mode. Explicit tag storage failures are `[precondition]` / exit 5. Optional
bookmark write failures retain research output with CLI stderr diagnostics
(`warning.code: tag_write_failed` under `--json`) or MCP `warnings`.

Storage is `tags.db` under the native configuration directory (Linux XDG config,
macOS Application Support, Windows AppData), with `KETCH_TAGS_PATH` as a complete
filename override. Handles are short-lived, independent of crawl/MCP page-cache
locks. Cache clear frees page storage for reuse but does not shrink cache.db.

## Backends and keys at a glance

| Surface | Keyless | Keyed | Set with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| search | **auto (default)**, ddg, searxng (self-hosted), exa, firecrawl, keenable, parallel, youcom | brave, tavily, serpbase, serply | `ketch config set brave_api_key <key>` / `tavily_api_key` / `serpbase_api_key` / `serply_api_key` (optional `firecrawl_api_key` / `youcom_api_key` lift the hosted caps) |
| code | grepapp, sourcegraph | github | `gh auth login` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN` / `ketch config set github_token <tok>` |
| docs | — | context7 (free key) | `ketch config set context7_api_key <key>` |

Search needs no key at all on the default `auto` backend. Naming a keyed backend explicitly without its key fails with `[precondition]` / exit 5 and an error message that names the fix (brave's includes the signup URL and the exact `config set` command).

## Config

- File: `~/.config/ketch/config.json`. Flags always override config values.
- `ketch config` is the one discovery call: effective settings plus `available_backends`, `available_code_backends`, `available_doc_backends`, as JSON. Never probe env vars instead.
- **Blind spots:** older builds do not report whether search/docs API keys are set (`github_token_source` is the exception; newer builds add key-presence booleans like `brave_api_key_set`), and no build reports reachability. To know a surface works, probe it — `ketch doctor` when available, else the setup verb's probe table.
- Keys (from README and `ketch config` output): `backend`, `code_backend`, `docs_backend`, `limit`, `searxng_url`, `sourcegraph_url`, `brave_api_key`, `context7_api_key`, `github_token`, `exa_api_key`, `firecrawl_api_key`, `firecrawl_url`, `keenable_api_key`, `tavily_api_key`, `serpbase_api_key`, `serply_api_key`, `youcom_api_key`, `browser`, `cache_ttl`, `url_rewrites`, `spa_markers`, `cookie_file`, `user_agent`, `extract_mode` (`clean` default, drops furniture by name too; `complete` keeps everything structure does not condemn; `KETCH_EXTRACT_MODE`), `mcp_tools` (allowlist over the six MCP tools; `KETCH_MCP_TOOLS`).
- `KETCH_CONFIG` selects the config filename. Isolate bookmark labs with `KETCH_TAGS_PATH` too; on Linux, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` isolates page bodies. macOS and Windows use their native cache directories, so an XDG override alone is not portable isolation.

## Cache

- Page cache in bbolt at `~/.cache/ketch/cache.db`, default TTL 72h (`cache_ttl` overrides). `ketch cache` shows page-cache stats and the tag index (path, counts, lock state), `ketch cache clear` empties the page cache and keeps bookmarks; both take `--json`.
- Single-process lock: the bbolt DB admits one process at a time. A long-running MCP server holds the lock for its whole lifetime, so concurrent CLI scrapes silently run cache-disabled — every fetch goes to the network. Observed live: `ketch doctor` reports `cache … locked by another process` while the server runs, and `ketch cache` shows `locked: true`. Needing heavy CLI and MCP use long-term → prefer CLI-only, or accept the tradeoff knowingly.
